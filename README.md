## Lessons Learned

I have learned how to use Flexbox, and it has made setting up galleries on websites much easier. Flexbox is a powerful and flexible layout model in CSS, allowing me to control the positioning, alignment, and size of elements within a container. This makes it ideal for creating responsive galleries that adapt well to different screen sizes and devices.
